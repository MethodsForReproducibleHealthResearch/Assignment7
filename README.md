# Assignment #7 Repository

This repository includes the simulated data for Assignment #7. Fork this repository and add your analysis as described in the canvas assignment.

The csv file for `cohort` in the `raw-data` folder includes 5,000 observations with variables `smoke`, `female`, `age`, `cardiac`, and `cost`.

The code generates a table of means and standard deviations of all variables by smoking status and also the standradized mean differences in those covariate values by smoking status. I then fit a linear model predicting cost using age and smoking status and present that analysis in a figure.
