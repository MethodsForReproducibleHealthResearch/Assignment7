# Assignment #7 Repository

This repository includes the simulated data for Assignment #7. Fork this repository and add your analysis as described in the canvas assignment.

The csv file for `cohort` in the `raw-data` folder includes 5,000 observations with variables `smoke`, `female`, `age`, `cardiac`, and `cost`.


This analysis includes:
- A descriptive table of the variables using the `table1` package with value labels
- Univariate logistic regression models examining the relationship between each predictor and cardiac issues
- A multivariate logistic regression model examining the combined effect of predictors on cardiac issues
- Plots showing the distribution of cardiac issues by gender and the predicted probabilities from the logistic regression model

### Descriptive Table
The descriptive table provides labeled summaries of the variables in the dataset. You can view the table below:

### Univariate Regression Analysis
The univariate logistic regression models showed that all predictors were significantly associated with cardiac issues. 

### Multivariate Regression Analysis
The multivariate logistic regression model showed that:
- **Age**: There is a significant negative association between age and the likelihood of having cardiac issues. For each additional year of age, the log odds of having cardiac issues decrease.
- **Cost**: There is a significant positive association between cost and the likelihood of having cardiac issues. For each additional unit increase in cost, the log odds of having cardiac issues increase.
- **Gender (Female)**: Gender does not have a significant association with the likelihood of having cardiac issues.
- **Smoker**: There is a significant negative association between being a smoker and the likelihood of having cardiac issues. The log odds of having cardiac issues are lower for smokers compared to non-smokers.
